I come across a lot of interresting stuff while working and i'd like to leave a little reminder to myself and anyone who reads this to go and investigate some of the stuff further.
So i thought i might do a little radar post every month just to keep track of all the new and wonderfull project i come across. 

So for this month i'm gona make a note of the following projects .. just to check back later. 

- Stackstorm: This [project](http://stackstorm.com/) is creating a totally awesome system for doing automatic self healing. You can hook it into your monitoring frameworks, tell it what to look for and then define actions to be taken. I've been looking for software like this for a while now and although there are other solutions out there, this one looks to be to most promesing by far. 
- Locust: Project [Locust](http://locust.io/) aims to create an opensource on-premise loadtesting system that lets you define user behaviour by means of python code. It's kinda like [Gatling](http://gatling.io) but as i really don't like scala (i'm more of a scripting type guy) this seems to me to be a better alternative. Given it's probably going to be slower but then again, us former operations guys will appreciate the straightforward pyhton approach.
- Consul-Template: Hashicorp, being the amazing company they are, have created yet another cool looking project to go with there already outstanding portfolio. This time it's an edition to Consul (their solution to service discovery) called [Consul-Template](https://github.com/hashicorp/consul-template). Basicly its a deamon that polls an existing Consul setup and handles template propagation where needed. 

These three projects are probably gonna take up most of my tinckering time for this month. I especially looking forward to getting my hand's on stackstorm. I see some really interresting applications there and i think it will make any and every IT environment just so much more awesome. 

So there you have it .. this is what i am looking at right now.

More next month (i hope)
